# Movie Watchlist

A place where you can keep track of all the movies or shows that you have been wanting to watch - or maybe those favourites that you'll be wanting to watch again!

With the rise in the number of streaming platforms available, it can be hard to keep track of all the different things you want to watch.
Movie Watchlist lets you keep track of everything in one spot.

## Future Plans:

- Implement a movie database API, where users can search for their selection and have info returned to them; image, director etc.
- Signup/login functionality handled by Firebase or similar.
- Editable comments on each entry.
